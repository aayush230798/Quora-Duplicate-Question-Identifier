#### Project Description 
##### Developed a duplicate question identifier using NLP techniques to determine if two questions have similar meanings.
##### Used the dataset provided by QUORA(popular question asking platform)
##### Conducted thorough data pre-processing, including text cleaning and tokenization and used NLTK python library to deal with stopwords efficiently.
##### Utilized various embedding techniques, such as BOW, TFIDF and Word2Vec o convert text data into vector representations.
##### Explored and experimented with multiple machine learning and deep learning models, including random forest, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks to achieve optimal performance.
##### Deployed the project on Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input questions and receive instant predictions.
